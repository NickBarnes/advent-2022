# Do the actual work for Advent of Code. Arguments are:
# - a list of lists of the lines in each section (separated by blank lines)
# - a list of the lines in the file
# - a list of lists of words on each line
# - a list of lists of digits on every line of a digit-grid file
# (I will usually only want one or sometimes two of these).

def run(sections, lines, words, grid):
    # print(len(sections),len(lines),len(words),len(grid))
